# VoxLink
VoxLink is a high-speed solution that allows interfacing of up to 100 sensors using a single high-speed host device. The communication protocol is agnostic to the sensor board, freeing the user from handling low-level communication. This project is part of my Bachelor's thesis at the Czech Technical University in Prague.
